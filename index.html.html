    <h2>What is "Football"⚽ and how is it played ?</h2>
    <p>Association football, more commonly <u><em>known as simply football or soccer</em></u>, is a team sport played between two <strong>teams of 11 players </strong>who primarily use their feet to propel the ball around a <u><b>rectangular field called a pitch</b></u>. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposition <mark>by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing side's rectangular framed goal</mark>. Traditionally the game has been played over two 45 minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries it is considered the world's most popular sport.</p>

        <h2> How did "Football"⚽ start ? </h2>
<p>Modern football originated in <b>Britain in the 19th century</b>. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA.</p>
